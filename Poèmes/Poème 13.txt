Cela avait été écrit en LLCE (Anglais): nous devions rédiger une réponse à la chanson "Boys don't cry"
Co-Autrice:  Mae

You don't need to break down at my feet
Please don't laugh about it
Come strong as a man
Because I know this is your domain

You can make the same mistake
Cause this time it won't be just a heart-ache
Now that you know me, that can't happen again
Because for you, it won't be a gain.

As you can see, you've been wrong.
I've answered you, even it has been so long.
I'm ready to get you back in my life
And finally become your wife.
